                    <h3>GAME SUMMARY</h3>
                    <p> Asteroids, Comets and Stars requires the player to
                        assist the space walker in his attempt to escape the ravenous hunger of the alien chasing him.
                        To do
                        this, you must best the alien in a series of games of Asteroids, Coments and Stars. Beat the
                        alien in enough games and the space walker will be able to reach his space ship and escape to
                        safety. Lose too many games, however, and the alien will eventually catch up to the space walker
                        and devour him. </p>

                    <h3>GAME INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
                    <p>Asteroids, Commets and Stars operates exactly like the popular school yard game, Rock, Paper,
                        Scissors. The only difference in this case is that instead of playing with Rocks, Paper and
                        Scissors, we are using Asteroids, Comets and Stars. In this variation of the game, Asteroids
                        beat Stars, Stars Beat Comets and Comets beat Asteroids. Each round is a instance of the game,
                        with the victor of each round awarded a point. With each round won or lost by the player, the
                        space walker will move in a given direction either towards his space ship or towards the alien.
                        If a round ends in a tie (meaning the the user choice is the same as the computer's choice),
                        then the space walker will remain at his current location. Once the space walker makes it to his
                        ship(player wins) or is eaten by the alien(player loses), the gaming session is over.</p>
